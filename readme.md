# :wrench: .files

First install:
Zsh using the official [website](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) so we run:

`brew install zsh zsh-completions`

and then we should install [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) running:

`curl -L git.io/antigen > antigen.zsh`

Finally you just

`git clone`

and go to the folder `dotfiles` and execute:
`sh install.sh`

_This is a **snapshot** my ([**@bookercodes**](https://twitter.com/bookercodes)) dot files. Whilst there is an
[`install.sh`](https://github.com/alexbooker/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) script, it's really intended for my own
use - you probably won't have much success with it - you would probably be better off reading the individual dot files and
copying the bits that interest you._
